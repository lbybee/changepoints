Description: Contains a series of methods for estimating change-points given user specified black-box models.  The methods include binary segmentation for multiple change-point estimation. For estimating each individual change-point the package includes simulated annealing, brute force, and for Gaussian Graphical Models an applications specific rank-one update implementation.  Additionally, code for Gaussian Graphical Models and Latent Dirichlet Allocation is included.  The goal of this package is to allow for the efficient estimation of change-points in complicated models with high dimensional data.
